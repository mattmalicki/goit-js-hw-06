First homework in JavaScript module in GoIT course.

## General info

That first homework wast after I've learned about what is JS. What are variables and their types, conditional instructions, loops, arrays and its functions, objects and its functions, functions itself, destructuring, callbacks and arrow functions, contects and classes.

But in this part I've learned about DOM elements, how to work with that. Also learned about events. This homework was spread in ten tasks:

### Tasks:

1. This task was about to count the amount of each elements inside li element in list and log it in console with each li header.

2. This task was about to get ingredients from js file and display it on website.

3. This task was about to create image gallery using array of objects in js file.

4. This task was about to make a counter with increase and decrease buttons that will add or sub and show it.

5. This task was about to use input and onChange event that would display your name on screen.

6. This task was about to check of how many characters was typed in input and change color of border. If the amount was below 6 then it would be red but if it was 6 or more then green.

7. This task was about to use input element with type range that would change the texts font-size.

8. This task was about to work with form elements. It logs typed values after submiting but if one of the value is missing it would use alert to inform about that.
